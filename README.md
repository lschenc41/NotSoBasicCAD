# NotSoBasicCAD
My NotSoBasicCAD assignments, consisting of models of a candlestick, hammer head, pressure plate, and box that were made to learn how to do sweeps and lofts in addition to more basic CAD concepts.

## A Little Practice
### Objective
The objective of this assignment was to make a tutorial box assembly out of two separate parts as well as a pressure plate in SolidWorks. The box is hollow with a protruding hole in one side of it, and the pressure plate consists of six hollow cylinders in a cricle arounda flat disk with a hole in the center, connected by a low ridge in between each cylinder. These projects teach some more basic CAD concepts, such as how to use fillets and circular patterns.

### Obstacles
I didn't encounter many obstacles while creating the candlestick and hammer head, mainly due to how in-depth the SolidWorks tutorial was. Every once in a while I would encounter a button (such as the "Hidden Lines Visible" button) that I couldn't find, but when you click on the icon in the SolidWorks tutorial it brings up the button in the actual part. Regarding the pressure plate, I ran into an issue where I couldn't figure out how to make a circular pattern to create te rest of the cylinders around the plate. However, I soon realized that it was in the drop-down menu of the Linear Pattern button in the Features tab.
## Sweeps and Lofts
### Objective
The purpose of this assignment was to create a candlestick shape as well as a hammer head shape in CAD using SolidWorks. The candlestick consists of a cylinder with a wide base curving in, a handle that curves inward, and an indentation in the top where a candle would go. The main goal of this project was to learn how to create sweeps in SolidWorks. The hammer head is the shape of a typical hammer without the indentation between the prongs, and the goal was to learn how to create lofts.

### Obstacles
As with the previous assignment, I didn't have many issues while making these parts. The one unclear part of this tutorial for me, however, was when I was making the curved protrusion on the hammer head; I wasn't sure which planes were in front of which. I managed to guess correctly the first time, which was Plane3, Plane2, Plane1, and Front, in order from front to back. For some reason the Front plane was actually behind the other ones, which may have contributed to my confusion regarding the order.
