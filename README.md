# NotSoBasicCAD
My NotSoBasicCAD assignments, consisting of models of a candlestick, hammer head, pressure plate, and box that were made to learn how to do sweeps and lofts in addition to more basic CAD concepts.

## Pressure Plate
### Objective
The objective of this assignment was, unsurprisingly, to make a pressure plate in SolidWorks. The shape consists of six hollow cylinders in a circle around a flat disk with a hole in the center, connected by a low ridge in between each cylinder. This project teaches some more basic CAD concepts, such as how to use fillets and circular patterns.

### Obstacles
As with the previous assignment, I didn't encounter many obstacles while making the pressure plate. One minor obstacle was that I couldn't figure out how to make a circular pattern to create the rest of the cylinders around the plate, but I soon realized that it was in the drop-down menu of the Linear Pattern button in the Features tab.
## Sweeps and Lofts
### Objective
The objective of this project was to create a candlestick shape as well as a hammer head shape in CAD using SolidWorks. The candlestick consists of a cylinder with a wide base curving in, a handle that curves inward, and an indentation in the top where a candle would go. The main goal of this project was to learn how to create sweeps in SolidWorks. The hammer head is the shape of a typical hammer without the indentation between the prongs, and the goal was to learn how to create lofts.

### Obstacles
I didn't encounter many obstacles while creating the candlestick and hammer head, mainly due to how in-depth the SolidWorks tutorial was. Every once in a while I would encounter a button (such as the "Hidden Lines Visible" button) that I couldn't find, but when you click on the icon in the SolidWorks tutorial it brings up the button in the actual part.
